CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that describes the presentation of web pages. Whereas HTML is what forms the structure of a web page, CSS is what we use to style the HTML with colors, backgrounds, font sizes, layout, and more. As you'll soon learn, CSS is one of the core technologies for designing and building websites.

What I learned from this course::
1. Getting Started with CSS:
Get started with one of the core technologies for designing and building websites and applications. In this stage, you'll learn about the evolution of CSS, helpful resources, and how to add CSS to a page.
2. Basic Selectors:
Selectors are one of the most important and powerful parts of CSS. In this stage, you'll learn the different ways we can target HTML elements with basic selectors.
3. Understanding Values and Units:
Every CSS property has a set of values it can accept. Most properties accept keywords that literally describe a value. Many properties also accept numbers, functions, length values, or a URL. In this stage, you'll learn the common values and units CSS properties accept.
4. The Box Model:
The box model is the basis of CSS layout because it dictates how elements are displayed and how they interact with each other.
5. Basic Layout:
In this stage, we'll continue styling our website with background properties and basic layout methods.
6. Enhancing the Design With CSS:
In this stage, we'll add the finishing touches to the page using CSS features that display rounded corners, box shadows, gradients and more. Then, we'll make sure our page looks good on all devices, with media queries.
7. Fundamental Concepts:
Now that we've explored many of the core features of CSS, it's time to take this knowledge further by learning important fundamental concepts. In this stage, you'll learn all about the CSS cascade, inheritance, and helpful tips and tools to practice and retain what youâ€™re learning.
